## Quotr

##### A demo AVL Quoting Engine
---

The world of Audio, Video, & Lighting integration is one where the integrator takes disparate pieces of equipment from many manufacturers and creates a cohesive system. Keeping track of the hundreds of thousands of parts that are available to an integrator can be a challenge. Second to this, presenting this information in a clean in succint way can also be difficult. These are the problems Quotr aims to fix. Easy to find parts and fast to build proposals.
